Instruction

* Edit the code to implement a 3D convolution with a 3x3x3 kernel in constant memory and a 3D shared-memory tiling.

* Edit the code to launch the kernel you implemented. The function should launch 3D CUDA grid and blocks. You may use any of the 3 tiling strategies taught in class.

* Answer the questions found in the questions tab.
